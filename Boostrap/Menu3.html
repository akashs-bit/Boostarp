                          Dear Students, <br />
                          His Holiness Poojya Dr. Sharnbaswappa Appaji, the 8th Mahadasoha Peetadhipati Sharnbasveshwar Samsthan, Kalaburagi; President, Sharanabasaveshwar Vidya Vardhak Sangha, Kalaburagi; Chancellor, Sharnbasva University, Kalaburagi has contributed significantly to the academic learning as the member of Academic Council, Senate and Syndicate of Karnataka University, Dharwad and took over the reins of the Sangha as the Secretary at a young age of 27 years and later as the President of the Sangha in 1983. He has guided the Sangha to blossom into a magnificent educational center of high stature. He blends education with the finest elements of culture by introducing Painting and Music at Graduation and Post Graduation Level without receiving any grants or financial assistance from the Government. Now the Sangha’s graph is always on the rise. His virtues and ideals, wisdom and blessings have laid the path of challenges and milestones in the pursuit of excellence and service. The institutions run by the Sangha have an impeccable track record in academics that bear a testimony to its high stature. The B.A., B.Com, B.Sc, MBA, MCA, BBM, BCA, Engineering and Technology courses have a record of 90% to 100% results.
                             
                        </p> 
                        <p style="text-align: justify;">
                            He started an institution known as Akhil Bharat Anubhava Mantap, which organizes series of lectures and promotes research and other activities. Under the aegis of this organization a fortnightly Journal called “Dasoha Jnana Ratna” is published. The journal is one among the few in India, which exclusively features spiritual, literary and philosophical aspects. Thus he has traversed vast grounds in the propagation of Dasoha and the oneness of man, which is timely in the present context. He has aimed to develop all facets of the society at large. The service of the Sangha under his stewardship is unique in the field of Art, Culture, Language, Literature, Music, Science and Management. He has tried to blend the ancient Indian Spiritualism with a dynamic pragmatism of the modern times and has grafted the western high-technology and modern ideas to the cultural heritage of India. He has always tried to explore new horizons of educational progress and diversification with his vision and dynamism. In thought, words and deeds he has tried to symbolize the spirit of Dasohabhava the supreme form of dedication and selfless service. The educational philosophy of Poojya Dr. Sharnbaswappa Appa describes the spirit of Dasohabhava which implies that the offerings of one’s self and ones service should be in the form of Anjali to God. This spirit which is practiced individually has been institutionalized by him. This enlightened Dasohabhava Sutras composed by him explain his interpretation of concept of Dasoha.
